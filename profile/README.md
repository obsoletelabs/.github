## Hi there 👋

This is an organisation about ObsoleteLabs.
As a community member, STAY OUT. This is my nonsense, not yours.
We dont like docs, it puts us out of business.
Our team eats cocopops and sulfuric acid for breakfast. Sometimes when we are feeling adventurous we pair it with a nice warm glass of lime juice.


<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
